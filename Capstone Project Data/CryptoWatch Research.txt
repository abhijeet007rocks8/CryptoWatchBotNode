Problem Statement:

Cryptocurrencies are quite a hot topic among the new generation of investors, 
many make fortune out of Crypto-Trading while many suffer heavy losses in it. 
While new tokens are coming out every single day, many of them are honeypots which take investors' money 
and then dissolve. Leaving the investors in heavy losses. 
The Game is completely based on High Risk & High Reward. 

People would say the benefit of being able to buy into tokens through these exchanges is simple, 
“You’re in early” and have the potential to make an exorbitant amount of money if they are successful.
If you’re lucky you will find that 1 in 100 token that makes you 100x or even 1000x your investment.

The clearest examples of this have been the success of Safemoon, Dogecoin, ASS finance and more recently Tiger King, 
where Early investors realised tens of thousands of dollars from as little as $200 invested at their launch. 
The support of Influencers and celebrities have added to the growth of these tokens and people are constantly 
looking for the next token which shares the same characteristics.

These Successes however, have paved the road for the Scammers to take advantage of unsuspecting investors who 
without doing their own research, blindly invest into tokens that have a large following or hype, 
only to have the opposite occur resulting in them losing their investment.

The Golden Mile is paved with thousands of Scams, Rug Pulls, 
Honey Pots and Unremorseful developers who have no identity, who hide behind alter ego’s and 
disappear as quickly as they arrived. People looking to make quick profits are comfortable with the high-risk, 
high reward methodology.


But we can reduce a little risk but considering the pieces of information related to Token and 
how it is being perceived by investors across the world the price trend etc. 
And after considering some of the factors we can make our investment decision. 
Now the next problem is how to find all this information.
Also, the new tokens which release at very low prices don't have records about 
them mentioned on the Crypto Websites because of their lack of popularity at the moment. 
But the data is available on Ethereum or Binance networks where the tokens are released. 
But to get that information we must have good knowledge of GraphQL and Crypto ParaDigms, 
which is not for all. Well, that is the aim of the project.


Types of scams:

## HONEYPOTS
A Honeypot is a type of Scam which allows people to buy tokens but prevents them from selling the token. 
This essentially locks the Base tokens into the contract where only the Contract Owner can sell tokens and 
drain Liquidity (Rug Pull)
Transaction history can help you identify them.


## Unlocked liquidity:
This is the most common scam today. Scammers know that if they create hype by promising large returns, 
and put effort into making flashy websites, get influencers on board and promoting themselves through 
different mediums that they can create the perfect storm for a scam.
The objective is to cause hype, increase awareness and create the perception that their token is the 
next big thing. The hype leads into a Pre-sale or fair launch where people buy their tokens, increase the 
liquidity supply and market cap for them to withdraw in an instant and steal people’s investment.
